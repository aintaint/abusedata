Redistributable game assets from the Crack dot Com Abuse public domain release.

The artwork and names used (including "Abuse" and the level designs), are copyrighted material and therefore this data is freely available as source code and technical facts, but it's not for commercial distribution.

The authors have historically had some cause to get frustrated about resale of the game in its entirety. To the best of my knowledge today, this archive represents a complete, freely redistributable data set corresponding to the commercial release of the game Abuse, with the copyrighted music and sound effects removed. 

I'm backing out other licenses and clarifying which portions of the source release are truly in the public domain. In theory, if you wanted to build an original metroidvania on the Abuse game engine, you'd fork this repo and replace all of the copyrighted work within.
